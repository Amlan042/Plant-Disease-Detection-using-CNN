# Plant Disease Prediction CNN

This project implements a cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify various plant diseases using image data. It leverages the power of deep learning to accurately diagnose plant health issues, helping farmers take timely and effective actions.

## Project Overview

The provided Colab notebook, `[plant_disease_prediction-CNN.ipynb](plant_disease_prediction-CNN.ipynb)`, delves into the development and application of this CNN model. It guides you through the entire process, from data preparation and model training to evaluation and interpretation of results.

## Dependencies

**Required libraries:**

* **TensorFlow/Keras:** The core deep learning framework used to build and train the CNN model.
* **NumPy:** Provides essential scientific computing functionalities for data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Used for creating informative visualizations of the data and model performance.
* (Optional) **Scikit-learn:** Offers additional tools for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

**Installation:**

If you haven't already, install these libraries using a package manager like `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn  # (optional)
